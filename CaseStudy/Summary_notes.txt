DATA LOADING
	- file loading & data visualize [cell:2]
	- retrieved some insights about data to check if any value is missing [cell:3, 4]




EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
	- Null values removal
No null values found

	- Feature exploration
	- Feature engineering	
Used StatsModel lib to provide better insights of data and identify which features actually contribute towards the classification of target class.
Loaded all the feature cloumns and ran OLS Regression test. (Ordinary Least Squares)
Seeing the model summary we concluded that the features having P-value (P>|t|) less than 0.05 threshold can be considered irrelevent to the target class that we are trying to classify.
Also we saw that the R-squared value is	0.607 that tells, are regression is very well explaining the target class. 
R-Squared value is found to check if the regression is even related to the target class or not. its value is between 0 and 1. its 0 if regression does not explain the target and 1 when reression totaly explains the target (unreal). [Cell:6]

	- Feature selection
	- Feature normaliztion/ standardization
Normalize all the feature values. [Cell:7]

	- Test Train split 
Divided the dataset in test-train split of (85:15) [Cell:8]




MODEL SELECTION AND BUILDING
	-Ran Supervised learning for 
	-Logistic regression
	-Desicion Tree
	-Random forest
	-Support Vector Classification
	-K-NearestNeighbors
Setup up Sklearn-pipelines for separate classifier to fit data and predict results with accuracy.[cell:10]

	-Artifical Neural network
Built using Keras with three hidden layers and Relu activation function. [cell:11]
